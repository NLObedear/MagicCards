This is my magic cards game.
To run the game just open the .exe file within the Magic cards folder.

This game is unfinished and you are unable to build a deck the only feature is the ability to play the game and verse the computer. 
This game is for presentation purposes only. 

GAME RULES? 
Once the game has started It wil leither be your turn or the computers turn (You can see via console). 
If it is your turn you have 3 options

 1. Play a Card (Only if oyu have enough mana) - Done by pressing the 1 key 
 2. Attack (Only if you have minions) - Done by pressing the 2 key 
 3. Ending your Turn - Done by clicking the end turn button 

There are visual queues to show you which phase you are in either play, attack or none. You can only end your turn if you are not in a phase. 

Playing A Card - Once this is selected you must select the card you wish to play from your hand the bottom row of cards. 
They are numbered from left to right starting at one. If the card is playable it will be moved to the field. 

Attacking - Once attacking is selected you must select a minion from your field to attack with. The selection works the same way as the hand. 
Keep in mind that minions can only attack the turn after they are played 
(There is no way to tell if a minion can attack or not due to lack of time). 
The game however will not let you enter attack phase if you cannot attack.
 Once you select the minion you wish to attack with you then select a minion to attack being from the enemy field. 
Selecting 8 will attack the enemy hero directly instead which is the goal of the game. 
Selecting 9 within the attack phase will leave it so you can end your turn. 
(I currently have a bug with not being able to choose which minion you attack as it still takes the previous key 
input from choosing your minion to attack with I have added a delay but the problem still exists) 
The goal of the game is to reduce the enemy hero to 0 health to win and if you reach 0 health you lose.
